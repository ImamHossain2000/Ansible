To install Docker on Debian Linux using Ansible, you can create a simple playbook. Below is a step-by-step guide and an example playbook that you can use.

**Step 1: Set Up Your Ansible Environment**
Install Ansible: Make sure Ansible is installed on your control machine. You can install it using apt on Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
```
**Step 2: Create the Ansible Playbook**
Create a new file called __install_docker.yml__:
```bash
---
- name: Install Docker on Debian
  hosts: docker_hosts
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt package index
      apt:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install required packages
      apt:
        name:
          - apt-transport-https
          - ca-certificates
          - curl
          - gnupg2
          - software-properties-common
        state: present

    - name: Add Docker's official GPG key
      apt_key:
        url: https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg
        state: present

    - name: Add Docker's stable repository
      apt_repository:
        repo: deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian {{ ansible_lsb.codename }} stable
        state: present

    - name: Install Docker CE
      apt:
        name: docker-ce
        state: latest

    - name: Start and enable Docker service
      systemd:
        name: docker
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Add user to the Docker group
      user:
        name: "{{ ansible_user }}"
        group: docker
        append: yes

```
**Step 3: Run the Ansible Playbook**
Use the following command to execute the playbook:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini install_docker.yml
```
**Step 4: Verify Docker Installation**
After running the playbook, you can verify that Docker is installed correctly by SSHing into your Debian host and running:
```bash
docker --version
```
**Notes**
- Make sure you replace `YOUR_HOST_IP` and `YOUR_SSH_USER` in the inventory file with your actual Debian host's IP address and your SSH username.
- This playbook installs Docker Community Edition (CE). If you need Docker Enterprise Edition (EE), you will need to modify the repository and package names accordingly.
- You may want to modify the playbook to suit your needs, such as adding more users to the Docker group or customizing the installation options.
