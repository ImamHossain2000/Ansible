What is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, orchestaration, and task automation. It is designed to simplify the management of large-scale IT environments by some key features of Ansible!

<strong>Agentless:</strong> Ansible does not require any agent software to be installed on the managed nodes. It uses SSH (Secure Shell) for communication, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.

Declarative Language: Ansible uses a simple, human-readable language called YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) to describe the automation tasks. This makes it easy for users to write and understand automation scripts, known as playbooks.

Idempotency: Ansible ensures that the tasks are idempotent, meaning that applying the same operation multiple times will produce the same result. This is crucial for maintaining consistency and reliability in automated processes.

Inventory Management: Ansible uses an inventory file to manage and group the target nodes. This allows users to organize and manage large numbers of servers easily.

Extensible: Ansible can be extended with custom modules, plugins, and roles. It has a large collection of pre-built modules that cover a wide range of tasks, from system configuration to cloud provisioning.

Playbooks and Roles: Playbooks are collections of tasks that define the desired state of a system. Roles are reusable sets of playbooks and other files that can be shared and reused across different projects.

Integration: Ansible integrates well with various infrastructure components, including cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), container orchestration systems (e.g., Kubernetes), and CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI).
